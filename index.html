                    <p>
                        In March of 2016, I made a decision to alter my eating and exercise habits. I had been living off a high carbohydrate diet with a lot of sugars. Eating this way I ballooned up to 335 pounds on a five foot nine inch frame. I had reached a low point in my life, and most likely was very near the end of my life if I didn't make drastic changes.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first few weeks I tried a low carbohydrate, low fat diet. With this diet I lost 18 pounds in two weeks, but there was a problem. I was constantly hungry. I knew I was close to going to fail in this diet just like I had in all previous diet attempts if something didn't change. I talked to a friend who had successfully used ketogenic diets to lose weight before and she pointed out I was doing it incorrectly. With Keto you're allowed a pretty high fat content in your diet. Once I introduced higher fat (but still low carbohydrate) foods into my diet, I noticed an immediate change. I was no long constantly hungry but I was still losing weight at a rapid rate.

                        It hasn't been easy. At first I would get winded walking 100 feet to my vehicle. Now I walk over 5 miles on the treadmill every day. Exercise is a component of losing weight, but permanent dietary changes are the key.

                        My purpose in creating this site is to explain the benefits of a low carbohydrate diet and hopefully help other people turn their lives around. As of this writing I've lost over 125 pounds. I don't know how long I've got left on this earth, but I do know that if I hadn't changed my lifestyle it would have been a lot less, and a lot more miserable.

            <p>While not as important as dietary changes, exercise does play a critical role in losing and maintaining weight loss. When I started my journey last year, I couldn't walk a half mile without being in major pain. Now I'm cruising at 4mph on an incline over 5 miles every day.</p>
