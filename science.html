                    <p>
                        Until fairly recently the general consensus in the scientific community was that you need a lot of carbohydrates to fuel your body. We now know this is not true. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fuel your body would normally use is glucose, carbohydrates that your body has broken down into sugars. With a low carbohydrate diet, your liver is forced to look for a back up source of energy. The liver then gets ketone bodies from fatty acids in your diet and body fat. When your body has reached this state, it is known as ketosis, and this is the basis of a keto diet. That is, forcing your body to look somewhere else for energy besides sugars produced by broken down carbohydrates.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        There are many resources on the web that will break down a keto diet that fats your needs. Most serious diets limit your carbohydrates intake to 20 carbohydrates a day. This will seem extreme at first but once you get used to eating more fats and proteins your body will adjust.

                You should always consult your doctor before beginning a new diet or exercise regimen to make sure you're up to the task.

                One of the problems with starting a keto diet is not getting enough electrolytes such as potassium. This can lead to heart palpitations, which are scary but usually not a serious issue. If you supplement your diet with enough potassium and magnesium then this should help you avoid palpitations and muscle cramps. For potassium I recommend buying a product called "No Salt" and mixing a quarter teaspoon of this with a Powerade Zero energy drink. A quarter teaspoon of No Salt gives you 650mg of potassium.
